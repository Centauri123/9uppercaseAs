A smol little hoi4 mod (hehe)

TO DO:
- Have just added copper successfully, just need to edit the GUI on the trade and production menu and then add it to states based on irl copper distribution
- Then, need to make it so radios need to be produced costing copper (and aluminium?). It should also be really cheap to produce, a little cheaper than support equipment maybe? (ADDED A GLOBAL COPPER MAP FOR REFERENCE)
